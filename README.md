Local, on-device dictation for macOS that turns speech into simulated keystrokes.

## Goal
Build a fast, privacy-preserving dictation app for macOS that can use local speech-to-text models (starting with Parakeet, but designed to support multiple engines over time).

## Status
Scaffolding only. No functional code yet.

## Planned features
- Microphone capture
- Pluggable local STT engines (Parakeet first)
- Text output as simulated keystrokes
- Push-to-talk and global hotkey
- Menu bar control

## Why this exists
To provide a lightweight, local alternative to cloud dictation tools.

## License
TBD
